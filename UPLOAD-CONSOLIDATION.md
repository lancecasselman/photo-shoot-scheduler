# Upload System Consolidation - Complete

## Summary
All photo upload methods have been consolidated to use **ONLY** the batch presigned URL method for maximum efficiency and performance.

## Consolidated Upload Method
The **batch presigned URL method** is now the ONLY way to upload photos to the platform.

### Primary Endpoints:
- `POST /api/r2/generate-presigned-urls` - Get presigned URLs for direct uploads
- `POST /api/r2/confirm-uploads` - Confirm successful uploads and process files

### Frontend Implementation:
- Uses `R2DirectUploader` class (located in `public/r2-direct-upload.js`)
- Supports concurrent uploads (up to 4 files simultaneously)
- Direct browser-to-R2 uploads (no server bottleneck)

## Removed/Deprecated Methods

### 1. Legacy Endpoints (Now Redirect)
- `/api/sessions/:id/upload-photos` - REMOVED, redirects to batch method
- `/api/r2/upload` - REMOVED, redirects to batch method
- `/api/r2/backup-upload` - REMOVED, redirects to batch method
- `/api/r2/gallery-upload` - REMOVED, redirects to batch method

### 2. Server-Side Processing
- Multer configuration removed
- Server-side file buffering eliminated
- No more temporary file storage on server

## Benefits of Consolidation

### Performance Improvements:
- **Direct uploads**: Files go straight from browser to R2
- **No server bottleneck**: Server doesn't handle file data
- **Concurrent uploads**: Up to 4 files upload simultaneously
- **Optimized for large files**: Handles RAW files efficiently

### Code Simplification:
- Single upload path to maintain
- Consistent error handling
- Unified quota checking
- Cleaner codebase

## How It Works

### Upload Flow:
1. **Client requests presigned URLs**: 
   ```javascript
   POST /api/r2/generate-presigned-urls
   {
     sessionId: "xxx",
     files: [
       { filename: "photo1.jpg", size: 1234567 },
       { filename: "photo2.raw", size: 9876543 }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Server returns presigned URLs**:
   - Validates user authentication
   - Checks storage quotas
   - Generates secure presigned URLs
   - Returns URLs for direct upload

3. **Client uploads directly to R2**:
   - Uses presigned URLs
   - Uploads up to 4 files concurrently
   - Shows progress for each file
   - No server involvement

4. **Client confirms uploads**:
   ```javascript
   POST /api/r2/confirm-uploads
   {
     sessionId: "xxx",
     uploadedFiles: [
       { filename: "photo1.jpg", key: "xxx", size: 1234567 },
       { filename: "photo2.raw", key: "yyy", size: 9876543 }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Server processes confirmed uploads**:
   - Updates database records
   - Triggers thumbnail generation
   - Updates storage tracking
   - Returns confirmation

## File Type Support

### Supported Formats:
- **Images**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, TIFF, BMP, SVG
- **RAW**: NEF, CR2, CR3, ARW, DNG, RAF, ORF, RW2, and more
- **Video**: MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WMV
- **Audio**: WAV, FLAC, AIFF, MP3
- **Documents**: PDF, TXT
- **Adobe**: PSD, AI, EPS

### File Size Limits:
- **RAW files**: Up to 5GB per file
- **Videos**: Up to 5GB per file
- **Gallery images**: Up to 500MB per file
- **Other files**: Up to 100MB per file
- **Batch limit**: 50 files per upload batch

## Frontend Usage

### Using R2DirectUploader:
```javascript
// Create uploader instance
const uploader = new R2DirectUploader({
  maxConcurrent: 4,
  sessionId: sessionId,
  onProgress: (fileName, percent, status) => {
    // Update progress UI
  },
  onFileComplete: (fileName, success) => {
    // Handle file completion
  },
  onAllComplete: (result) => {
    // Handle batch completion
  }
});

// Upload files
const result = await uploader.uploadFiles(files, sessionId);
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Code:
- Any code calling deprecated endpoints will receive a 308 redirect
- Redirect response includes instructions to use the new method
- Frontend already updated to use R2DirectUploader exclusively

### For New Features:
- Always use R2DirectUploader class for uploads
- Never implement server-side file handling
- Follow the established upload flow

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections:
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Storage quota enforcement
- File type validation
- Size limit enforcement
- Automatic cleanup of unauthorized uploads
- Secure presigned URLs with expiration

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses:
- `401`: Authentication required
- `413`: Storage quota exceeded
- `400`: Invalid request parameters
- `308`: Endpoint deprecated (redirect to new method)

## Testing

### Test Upload Flow:
1. Open the application
2. Navigate to any session
3. Click "Upload Files" button
4. Select multiple files (mix of images, RAW, etc.)
5. Observe concurrent upload progress
6. Verify files appear in gallery after upload

### Expected Behavior:
- Progress shown for each file
- Up to 4 files upload simultaneously
- Failed uploads reported clearly
- Storage quota warnings displayed
- Successful uploads confirmed

## Maintenance

### Key Files:
- **Frontend**: `public/r2-direct-upload.js` - Upload client
- **Frontend**: `public/script.js` - UI integration
- **Backend**: `server/r2-api-routes.js` - API endpoints
- **Backend**: `server/r2-file-manager.js` - R2 operations

## Support

If you encounter any issues with the consolidated upload system:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify authentication status
3. Check storage quota availability
4. Ensure file types are supported
5. Review network requests for failed uploads
