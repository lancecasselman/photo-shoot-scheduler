# Final Authentication Test - photomanagementsystem.com

## Test Results (After Firebase Domain Authorization)

Date: July 27, 2025
Domain: https://photomanagementsystem.com
Status: **READY FOR TESTING**

## What Should Work Now:

1. **Landing Page**: https://photomanagementsystem.com/
   - Should load with "Launch App" button

2. **Authentication Flow**: 
   - Click "Launch App" → redirects to /auth.html
   - Google Sign-in should work without "unauthorized domain" error
   - Email/Password sign-in should also work
   - After successful login → redirects to /app (main application)

3. **Main Application**: https://photomanagementsystem.com/app
   - Should require authentication (redirect to /auth.html if not logged in)
   - After login: Full photography management system

## Firebase Configuration Completed:
- ✅ Domain added to Firebase authorized domains
- ✅ Server running with authentication enabled
- ✅ Database and API endpoints operational

## Next Test:
Try the complete authentication flow:
1. Visit https://photomanagementsystem.com/
2. Click "Launch App"
3. Sign in with Google or Email/Password
4. Should access the full photography management system

**Google OAuth Update Status:**
- Firebase domain authorization: ✅ Complete
- Google Cloud Console propagation: ⏳ In progress (5-15 minutes)

If you see "unauthorized domain" errors, this is normal - Google API changes take time to propagate globally.

## Success Indicators:
- No "auth/unauthorized-domain" errors
- Successful Google Sign-in popup
- Redirect to main app after authentication
- Full access to session management features
