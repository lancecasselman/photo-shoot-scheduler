ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: SESSION MANAGEMENT PROTECTION ðŸš¨
The session management system is COMPLETE and WORKING PERFECTLY. 
DO NOT modify any session-related code or files.

TASK: Build a professional photography contract system with e-signature capabilities

**Core Requirements:**

1. **Contract Templates Library:**
   - Wedding Photography Contract
   - Portrait Session Contract
   - Commercial Photography Contract
   - Event Photography Contract
   - Mini Session Contract
   - Newborn/Maternity Contract
   Each template should include standard sections:
   - Client information fields
   - Session details (date, time, location, duration)
   - Pricing and payment terms
   - Cancellation/rescheduling policy
   - Image delivery timeline
   - Usage rights and copyright
   - Model release (if applicable)
   - Liability limitations

2. **Contract Editor:**
   - Rich text editor for customizing contracts
   - Variable placeholders that auto-fill from session data:
     {{client_name}}, {{session_date}}, {{session_price}}, {{deposit_amount}}
   - Ability to save custom contract templates
   - Preview mode before sending
   - Add/remove/edit clauses
   - Include photographer's business terms

3. **E-Signature Integration:**
   - Generate unique signing link for each contract
   - Email contract to client with signing instructions
   - Capture typed signature or drawn signature
   - Date/time stamp of signature
   - IP address logging for legal compliance
   - Two-party signing (client and photographer)

4. **Contract Management:**
   - Track contract status: Draft, Sent, Viewed, Signed, Expired
   - Automatic reminders for unsigned contracts
   - Store signed contracts with session records
   - Generate PDF of signed contract
   - Email signed copy to both parties automatically
   - Contract expiration dates (e.g., expires in 7 days if unsigned)

5. **Integration with Existing System:**
   - Link contracts to sessions (READ session data, don't modify)
   - Auto-populate contract from session details
   - Update session workflow checkbox when contract is signed
   - Store contract status in separate contracts table

6. **Database Schema:**
   Create new tables:
   - contracts (id, session_id, template_id, content, status, created_at, sent_at, signed_at)
   - contract_templates (id, name, content, category, is_default)
   - contract_signatures (id, contract_id, signer_name, signature_data, signed_at, ip_address)
   - contract_audit_log (contract_id, action, timestamp, details)

7. **User Interface:**
   - Contracts tab in main navigation
   - Dashboard showing pending/signed contracts
   - Quick actions: Send Contract, View, Download PDF
   - Template management section
   - Contract analytics (signature rate, average time to sign)

8. **Security & Legal:**
   - Encrypted storage of contracts
   - Audit trail of all contract actions
   - Legally binding e-signature compliance
   - SSL/HTTPS for signature pages
   - Tamper-proof signed documents

9. **File Structure:**
   Create new files:
   - contracts-manager.js (main contract logic)
   - contracts-routes.js (API endpoints)
   - contracts-dashboard.html (UI)
   - contract-editor.html (editing interface)
   - contract-templates.js (template management)
   - signature-capture.js (e-signature functionality)

10. **Notifications:**
    - Email client when contract is ready to sign
    - Email photographer when contract is signed
    - SMS option for urgent contracts
    - In-app notifications for contract updates

**Expected Result:**
A complete contract management system where photographers can:
- Select/customize professional contract templates
- Send contracts for e-signature
- Track signature status
- Automatically receive signed copies
- Store contracts with their sessions
All without touching the existing session management system.

Please implement with professional UI/UX and ensure legal compliance for e-signatures.
