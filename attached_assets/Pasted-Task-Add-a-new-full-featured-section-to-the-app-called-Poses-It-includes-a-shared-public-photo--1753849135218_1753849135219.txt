Task: Add a new full-featured section to the app called “Poses.” It includes a shared, public photo gallery, a personal favorites gallery for each user, and a photo submission form. All data must be linked to the submitting photographer.

Step 1: Add New Sidebar Route
- Add a new route in the sidebar labeled “Poses”
- Clicking it opens a landing page with navigation to:
  - Shared Gallery
  - Favorites
  - Submit a Photo

Step 2: Shared Pose Gallery
- Create a new page at /poses/shared
- Fetch all documents from Firestore at /publicPhotoGallery/ where approved == true
- Display photos in a responsive grid
- Each photo card includes:
  - Full-size image or thumbnail
  - Photographer name (displayed beneath or as overlay)
  - Category tags
  - “Favorite” button (heart icon), visible if logged in
- Add filters at the top by:
  - Category (wedding, senior, family, etc.)
  - Tag search input (match from tags array)
- Sort options: newest, most favorited

Step 3: Photographer Favorites Gallery
- Create a new page at /poses/favorites
- For the logged-in user, fetch:
  - /users/{userId}/favoritePoses/
- Display the associated pose photo cards from /publicPhotoGallery/ (joined by poseId)
- Allow users to remove poses from their favorites

Step 4: Submit a Photo Page
- Create a form at /poses/submit
- Form fields:
  - File uploader for 1 image
  - Optional category dropdown (wedding, family, senior, etc.)
  - Optional tags input (comma separated or chip input)
- On submit:
  - Upload photo to Firebase Storage at /shared-gallery/
  - Create document in /publicPhotoGallery/ with fields:
    - imageUrl (download URL)
    - category (array)
    - tags (array)
    - photographerId (from auth)
    - photographerName (from user profile)
    - submittedAt (timestamp)
    - approved: false
- Show a confirmation that submission is pending approval

Step 5: Firebase Firestore + Storage Setup
- Firestore Collection: /publicPhotoGallery/
  - Fields:
    - imageUrl
    - category (array)
    - tags (array)
    - photographerId
    - photographerName
    - submittedAt
    - approved
    - favoritedBy (array of userIds)

- Favorites Subcollection:
  - /users/{userId}/favoritePoses/{poseId}

- Firebase Storage:
  - /shared-gallery/{fileName}
  - Public read access for all users

Step 6: Firebase Rules
- Only authenticated users can write to /publicPhotoGallery/
- Only admin users can set approved == true
- Only the current user can write to /users/{userId}/favoritePoses/

Step 7: Admin Approval Panel (Optional Phase)
- Add simple backend or Firestore viewer to allow admin to mark approved: true
- Filter unapproved submissions

Step 8: UX Notes
- All views must be fully mobile responsive
- Default fallback if no photos are found
- Display photographer credit clearly on all images
- Display uploaded date (optional)
- Optimize for lazy-loading and fast image preview

Goal:
Create a platform-wide resource for pose inspiration using real user-submitted photos. All content is linked to photographers and categorized for easy searching. Users can favorite poses and reference them in their shoot planning or marketing tools.
