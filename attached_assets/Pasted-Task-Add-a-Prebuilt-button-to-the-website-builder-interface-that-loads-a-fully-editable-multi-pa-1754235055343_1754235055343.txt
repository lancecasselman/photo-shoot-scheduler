Task:
Add a “Prebuilt” button to the website builder interface that loads a fully editable, multi-page website template called “Light & Airy Portfolio.”

Details:

The template should include Home, Portfolio, About, Contact, and Pricing pages.

Each page should be made up of standard blocks (hero, gallery, about, testimonial, packages, forms, etc.) as described in the JSON example below.

All text, images, and settings must be fully editable by the user within the builder.

The user can click the “Prebuilt” button at any time to create a new site using this template.

Ensure the implementation is safe and does not overwrite the user’s existing website without confirmation.

Do not use any emojis in code, comments, or user interface elements.

Test thoroughly to ensure all blocks render correctly and all fields are editable.

Provide documentation/comments in the code explaining each step for future maintainability.

Sample Template JSON:
(Copy/paste or import this structure for the template’s initial content. Adapt to your builder’s format if needed.)
