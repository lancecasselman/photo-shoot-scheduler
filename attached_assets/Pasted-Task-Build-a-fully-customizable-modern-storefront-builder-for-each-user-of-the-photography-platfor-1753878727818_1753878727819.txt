Task: Build a fully customizable, modern storefront builder for each user of the photography platform. Every user should be able to create a beautiful, multi-page public website with a print store, gallery, blog, and about page. All functionality must be fully mobile responsive and visually polished, significantly exceeding the quality of prior versions and competing builders like Pixieset.

PHASE 1: INITIAL STRUCTURE

1. Create a new top-level section in the user dashboard called “Storefront”
2. Add routing to a builder interface with:
   - Sidebar for navigation between pages (Home, About, Gallery, Print Store, Contact)
   - Live preview canvas
   - Editor sidebar for adjusting layout, text, images, and theme settings

PHASE 2: TEMPLATE ENGINE

1. Build 4-6 professionally styled, mobile-optimized templates to choose from
   - Themes include: Light & Airy, Bold & Modern, Earthy Neutral, Minimal Serif
   - Each theme includes:
     - Page layouts for: Home, About, Gallery, Store, Contact
     - Default colors, fonts, and structure
     - Responsive layouts with header, hero, section blocks, footer
   - All templates live under `/storefront-templates/{template-name}/`

2. Allow user to preview templates and select one to activate
   - Save selection to Firebase: `/users/{userId}/storefront/config/theme`

PHASE 3: PAGE CONTENT + EDITOR

1. Each page is editable:
   - Home: Hero image, intro text, call-to-action
   - About: Bio text, profile image, social links
   - Gallery: Choose photos from uploaded sessions or mark favorites
   - Store: Upload images for sale, choose print products via WHCC
   - Contact: Editable form, email destination set by user

2. Enable drag-and-drop block ordering per page
   - Block types: text, photo grid, CTA, testimonial, embedded video, pricing table
   - Each block has prebuilt layouts

3. All content saved to Firebase under: `/users/{userId}/storefront/content/{page}`

PHASE 4: PRINT STORE INTEGRATION

1. Integrate WHCC API:
   - Allow users to select products to offer
   - Upload print-resolution images per product
   - Set price markup per product (or use default pricing)
   - Store orders and forward fulfillment to WHCC

2. Orders saved to `/users/{userId}/storefront/orders/`

3. Optional Stripe Connect setup for direct payouts, or route payments through platform

PHASE 5: ADVANCED FEATURES

1. Blog System
   - Add blog page with title, cover image, rich-text body
   - Simple WYSIWYG editor
   - Save posts to `/users/{userId}/storefront/blog/`

2. Moodboard Integration
   - Let user feature favorite pose inspiration from shared pose gallery
   - Add a "Moodboard" block to homepage or gallery

3. Custom Domain Support
   - Add domain field in settings (e.g., `johnsmithphoto.com`)
   - Use Firebase Hosting or Vercel for publishing

4. Mobile Optimization
   - All views must fully support mobile layouts
   - Hamburger menu on mobile
   - Touch-friendly buttons, block spacing, and content

PHASE 6: DEPLOY + PUBLISH

1. Add “Preview Site” and “Publish” buttons
2. Generate public site at:
   - `yourplatform.com/{username}`
   - Optional custom domain if set
3. Publishing uses Firebase Hosting or static site generation as backend

PHASE 7: SETTINGS PANEL

1. Theme toggles:
   - Fonts, color palette, spacing presets
   - Global layout options (boxed vs full width, padding toggles)

2. Site visibility:
   - Public, password-protected, or hidden
   - Page-level visibility toggles (e.g., hide blog or gallery)

FINAL GOAL:
Each user has a stunning, multi-page, professionally designed storefront site that includes a home page, about page, contact page, public gallery, blog, and WHCC-integrated print store. It is fully customizable with drag-and-drop content blocks, layout selection, and personal branding options. This builder must exceed the visual and usability standard set by Pixieset and Format.
