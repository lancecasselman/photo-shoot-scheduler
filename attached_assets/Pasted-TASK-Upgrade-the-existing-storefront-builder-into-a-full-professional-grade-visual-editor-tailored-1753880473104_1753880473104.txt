TASK: Upgrade the existing storefront builder into a full, professional-grade visual editor tailored for photographers. The editor should include inline editing, image replacement, 20 fully prebuilt website themes, and full-page set templates (home, about, gallery, store, contact). All changes should update visually and in real-time, with zero reloads or save buttons.

PHASE 1: CLICK-TO-EDIT ENGINE
1. Implement live click-to-edit support for all text and images inside the preview window.
2. When the user clicks any text:
   - Replace it with an editable input or contentEditable element
   - Auto-save changes to local state and Firebase under:
     `/users/{userId}/storefront/content/{pageName}`
3. When the user clicks any image:
   - Open a file picker or image selector
   - Upload to Firebase Storage and replace the preview src
   - Save metadata path to Firestore for the correct block and element

4. Enable drag-to-reorder sections and toggles to show/hide blocks
   - Blocks must include: hero, image grid, testimonial, about blurb, pricing, call-to-action, blog preview

PHASE 2: 20 PREBUILT VISUAL THEMES
1. Create a themes directory: `/storefront-templates/{template-name}/`
2. Add 20 beautifully designed, mobile-responsive full website templates
   Each template should include:
   - Page files: `home.html`, `about.html`, `gallery.html`, `store.html`, `contact.html`
   - Soft animations and modern styling
   - Distinct visual styles (see below for categories)
3. Theme categories:
   - Light + Airy (already working)
   - Bold & Editorial
   - Earthy Boho
   - Modern Luxe
   - Coastal Lifestyle
   - Minimal Portfolio
   - Monochrome Studio
   - Dark Moody Wedding
   - Romantic Serif
   - Fashion-Forward
   - Commercial Grid
   - Film Vibe (grainy/retro)
   - Urban Black & Gold
   - Cottagecore Vibes
   - Rustic Barn Style
   - Luxury Fine Art
   - Street Photography Layout
   - Scenic Landscapes (horizontal showcase)
   - Scrolling Story Layout (w/ full-page sections)
   - Storybook Magazine

PHASE 3: LAYOUT + CONTENT ENGINE
1. Create a dynamic page loader that:
   - Pulls the selected theme and layout from Firebase
   - Allows each page (`home`, `about`, etc.) to have its own layout variation
   - Loads blocks dynamically with template metadata

2. Save all editable content to Firestore under:
   `/users/{userId}/storefront/content/{pageName}`

3. Allow switching themes while preserving saved content
   - If block types match, keep content inserted
   - Otherwise, prompt user to map blocks or reset

PHASE 4: PUBLISHING
1. Final rendered page should live at:
   `yourplatform.com/{username}`
2. User can preview all changes before publishing
3. Firebase Hosting or static page build should deploy live version on publish

PHASE 5: ADMIN PANEL (FOR YOUR TEAM)
1. Allow your team to upload new themes
2. Manage user storefronts, reset if broken
3. Add analytics dashboard later (views, orders, link clicks)

FINAL GOAL:
Each user can build a gorgeous, modern, multi-page storefront by selecting a prebuilt template and clicking directly into the page to edit text and images. All layout styles are built-in and tailored to professional photographers. Visual feedback is instant. The experience must exceed the quality and usability of Pixieset, Format, and other competitors in both beauty and simplicity.
