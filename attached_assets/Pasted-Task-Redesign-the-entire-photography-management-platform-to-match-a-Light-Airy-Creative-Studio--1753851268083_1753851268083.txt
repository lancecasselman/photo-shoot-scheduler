Task: Redesign the entire photography management platform to match a "Light + Airy Creative Studio" theme. This includes updating the layout, color scheme, components, and typography across every section of the app to reflect the third mockup in the provided UI reference.

Design Characteristics:
- Warm, inviting colors
- Rounded corners on all cards, buttons, and containers
- Generous white space
- Light pastel accent colors
- Drop-down navigation style with subtle hover animations
- Clean, soft typography

Typography:
- Headers: Cormorant Garamond or similar elegant serif
- Body: Quicksand, Inter, or a clean sans-serif
- Font sizes should prioritize readability and modern spacing (16px–18px body text, larger headers)

Color Palette:
- Background: #FAFAF8 (soft white)
- Accent 1: #EADBC8 (warm beige)
- Accent 2: #D9E1D8 (sage gray-green)
- Buttons: Muted gold (#C1A35E) and dusty rose (#E8C1B4)
- Text: #1F1F1F for primary, #555 for secondary

General Layout:
- Top navigation bar with logo, notifications, and dropdown profile menu
- Sidebar with dropdown or collapsible sections for navigation
- Main content area with large section headers, cards, and icons
- All pages should be fully responsive for mobile and tablet

Update the following sections and features:

1. Login and Signup Pages:
- Apply soft background gradients or color overlays
- Rounded input fields and buttons
- Friendly welcoming text in header

2. Main Dashboard:
- Convert layout to 2-column: sidebar and content panel
- Use rounded cards with light drop shadows
- Replace sharp icons with softer, line-based icons

3. Sessions Section:
- Update session cards with pastel accent headers
- Add light hover and active states
- Group session types visually with muted color indicators

4. Galleries:
- Rounded photo containers with soft drop shadows
- Larger thumbnails, space between cards
- Subtle hover animations for viewing and editing

5. Poses Section:
- Shared gallery grid with rounded image containers
- Pastel filter buttons
- Lightbox design should use soft transitions and minimal close controls

6. Marketing Tools:
- Convert tool cards to soft white backgrounds with thin gold borders
- Button actions should use soft accent colors
- Add hover tooltips styled with soft corners and shadows

7. Blog / Social / Email Creator:
- Editor backgrounds should be off-white
- Button bars use sage or muted gold
- Fonts and preview panes should match the overall type system

8. Submit Forms (gallery, photo, pose):
- Rounded fields and buttons
- Required fields indicated with clean styling (no harsh red)
- Success messages in muted green tones

9. Mobile Design:
- Collapse sidebar into a hamburger menu
- Buttons and inputs must be touch-friendly
- Maintain visual style and spacing across breakpoints

Global Styles:
- Border radius: 8px or 12px across components
- Box shadows: soft, low-opacity
- Animations: slide, fade-in, dropdowns — subtle and quick

Final Goal:
The entire app should reflect a boutique creative studio aesthetic — clean, welcoming, and modern. All components, typography, and UI interactions should follow this new visual language.
