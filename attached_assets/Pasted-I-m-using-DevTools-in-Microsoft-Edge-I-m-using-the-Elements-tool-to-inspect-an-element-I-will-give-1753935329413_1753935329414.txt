I'm using DevTools in Microsoft Edge. I'm using the Elements tool to inspect an element. I will give you, below, the DOM structure where the element I am currenlty inspecting is located. I will provide the element itself and its ancestors, just like they appear in the DOM. I'll omit the rest of the DOM to keep it short. I will also give the list of CSS rules that apply to the elements that I'm providing in the DOM stucture. I want to ask you questions about this to fix the HTML/CSS issues that I'm facing. Please act as a friendly CSS expert who is willing to help me debug my issues. Whenever possible, provide fixes for the issues that I'm facing. If I'm asking questions about an element different than the one that's selected and you can't answer, please tell me. When I say "this element", "the element" or "current element", I mean the middle of the deepest elements in the DOM tree. DOM structure: `html <body><!-- Mobile Navigation Overlay --><div class="mobile-nav-overlay" id="mobileNavOverlay" onclick="closeMobileNav(event)"></div><!-- Visual Editor Interface --></body>` CSS rules: `css /** For the <div class="mobile-nav-overlay" id="mobileNavOverlay" onclick="closeMobileNav(event)"> element **/ * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; } .mobile-nav-overlay { position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); z-index: 200; opacity: 0; visibility: hidden; transition: all 0.3s ease; } /** For the <body> element **/ * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; } body { font-family: var(--font-sans); background: var(--cream); color: var(--deep-charcoal); line-height: 1.6; } ` Help me resolve HTML and CSS issues with this element. I will ask specific follow-up questions in the conversation
Got it, John — I'm ready to roll up my virtual sleeves and dig into this overlay situation with you.

So far, here's the high-level overview of what I see:

You’ve got a full-screen overlay (.mobile-nav-overlay) meant to show on mobile, but it’s styled as invisible by default (opacity: 0, visibility: hidden).

The intention is likely for it to fade in via a transition when activated, possibly through JavaScript by setting opacity: 1 and visibility: visible.

The overlay is positioned with position: fixed, taking up the entire viewport with a semi-transparent black background.

To help you more specifically, just let me know:

What's the issue you're seeing right now — is the overlay not appearing, not covering properly, click events not firing, or something else?

Are you toggling a class or changing style properties via JavaScript? If so, which ones?

When you're ready, hit me with the symptoms or the behavior you're expecting but not getting. I’ll help you troubleshoot step by step, or even write out the fix if we need to tweak the CSS or script. Let’s make this thing behave
