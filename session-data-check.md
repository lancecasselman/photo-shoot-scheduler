# Session Data Verification

## Issue Identified
You can't see your sessions on the custom domain because:

1. **Authentication Required**: The system requires login to access sessions
2. **Google OAuth Still Propagating**: Can't log in via Google yet (5-15 min wait)
3. **User-Specific Sessions**: Sessions are tied to your user account

## Your Sessions Are Safe
All your session data is stored in the PostgreSQL database and will appear once you log in.

## Temporary Solutions

### Option 1: Use Replit Domain (Immediate Access)
- Visit: https://photo-shoot-scheduler-lancecasselman.replit.app
- Log in with Google (works immediately)
- View all your existing sessions

### Option 2: Wait for Google OAuth (Custom Domain)
- Wait 5-15 minutes for Google API propagation
- Then sign in at: https://photomanagementsystem.com/auth.html
- All sessions will appear after login

### Option 3: Email/Password Authentication (Custom Domain)
- Try email/password sign-in on custom domain
- This doesn't depend on Google OAuth
- Should work immediately if you have email/password set up

## Database Status
The database contains all your sessions - they're just hidden until authentication completes.

## Authentication Flow
1. Both domains share the same database
2. Sessions are user-specific (tied to your Firebase user ID)
3. Must be logged in to see your sessions
4. Once Google OAuth propagates, custom domain will work identical to Replit domain

Your data is completely safe - just need to authenticate to access it!
