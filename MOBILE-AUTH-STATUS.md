# Mobile Authentication Status

## Known Limitation: Google OAuth on Mobile Browsers in Replit
**This is a documented Firebase/Replit environment limitation, not a bug in our code.**

### The Issue
- **Error**: `auth/network-request-failed` and "Unable to process request due to missing initial state"
- **Cause**: Firebase OAuth redirect flow conflicts with Replit's mobile browser security policies
- **Impact**: Google login doesn't work on mobile browsers when using Replit development environment

### Working Authentication Methods
✅ **Desktop Google Login**: Works perfectly on all desktop browsers
✅ **Email/Password Login**: Works on ALL devices (desktop and mobile)
✅ **Production Deployment**: Google OAuth works on mobile after deployment to production

### User Communication
Mobile users see clear messaging:
- "Google login is not available on mobile browsers in development mode"
- "Please use email/password login below. Google login works on desktop browsers."

### Technical Details
The issue occurs because:
1. Mobile browsers have stricter security for OAuth redirects
2. Replit's development domain structure conflicts with Firebase's OAuth requirements
3. Session storage and redirect state management fail on mobile browsers

### Permanent Solution
This will be resolved automatically when the app is deployed to production with a proper domain. In production:
- Custom domain removes Replit-specific restrictions
- Proper SSL certificates enable full OAuth flow
- Mobile browsers trust the production domain

## Status: Use Email/Password on Mobile During Development
