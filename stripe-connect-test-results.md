## Code Implementation Review

### PaymentPlanManager.sendPaymentInvoice()
The implementation correctly follows Stripe Connect patterns:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Customer creation on connected account
const customer = await stripe.customers.create({
    // customer data
}, {
    stripeAccount: photographer.stripeConnectAccountId
});

// ✅ CORRECT: Invoice creation on connected account
const invoice = await stripe.invoices.create({
    // invoice data
}, {
    stripeAccount: photographer.stripeConnectAccountId
});
```

**Key Strengths**:
- Proper use of `stripeAccount` parameter for all API calls
- Comprehensive error handling
- Metadata tracking for sessions and payments
- Support for optional tips
- Proper invoice finalization and sending

## Issues & Recommendations

### Critical Issues
1. **Stripe Connect Onboarding Required**
   - **Impact**: Payments cannot be processed until onboarding is complete
   - **Solution**: Complete Stripe Connect onboarding process
   - **Priority**: HIGH

### Minor Issues
