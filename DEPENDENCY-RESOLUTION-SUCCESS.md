# Dependency Resolution - COMPLETE SUCCESS

## ‚úÖ Clean Dependency Approach - RESOLVED

### **Problem Solved:**
The node_modules and package-lock.json files were in an inconsistent state, causing dependency conflicts and preventing proper Capacitor synchronization.

### **Solution Applied:**
1. **Complete Clean:** Removed `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json`
2. **Selective Reinstall:** Used package manager to install core dependencies
3. **Capacitor Sync:** Successfully synchronized both Android and iOS projects

### **Results:**

**‚úÖ Server Status:**
- Photography Management System: ‚úÖ RUNNING
- All core services initialized successfully
- Database connected and operational
- Firebase integration active
- R2 cloud storage connected
- OpenAI services operational
