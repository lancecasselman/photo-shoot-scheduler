# Session Access Issue - Solution Found

## Problem Identified
Your sessions exist in the database but are tied to specific user accounts. You need to log in with the correct account to see them.

## Session Distribution in Database:
- **User ID 44735007**: 3 sessions (Tyler Decker, Tina & Nick Balser, Maddie & Taya)
- **Anonymous User**: 5 sessions (older test sessions)
- **Test User**: 1 session

## Solution: Use Correct Login Account

### Your Real Sessions (User ID: 44735007)
These are your actual photography sessions:
1. Tyler Decker (family session) - July 25
2. Tina and Nick Balser (family session) - July 25  
3. Maddie and Taya (engagement session) - July 24

### To Access Your Sessions:
1. **Log in with your main Google account** (likely lancecasselman2011@gmail.com)
2. **Or the email associated with user ID 44735007**

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Check Your User Account
- Log in to either domain with Google
- Check which user ID you get
- Sessions will only show for the matching user ID

### Option 2: Admin Access (Temporary)
If needed, I can temporarily enable admin mode to show all sessions regardless of user.

### Option 3: Migrate Sessions
If you're logged in with a different account, I can migrate the sessions to your current user ID.

## Root Cause:
The authentication system is working correctly - it's just that sessions are user-specific for security. You need to authenticate with the same account that created the sessions.

Try logging in with your main Google account first!
